# legacy-lwjgl3

A hacky over-engineered project that runs LWJGL3 on legacy-fabric minecraft versions (current only tested 1.8.9),
Allowing you to use modern LWJGL features and libraries on older minecraft versions.

## Credits
A whole lot of this code is just code from the original LWJGL 2 project modified to work with LWJGL 3, Thanks so much to
the LWJGL devs for making their license so permissive.

and a big thanks to gudenau for the original F*rge mod <https://github.com/gudenau/MC-LWJGL3> that did the same thing,
thanks as a big portion of this code is from that project.

# Usage

## Dev Environments
Just add this to your build.gradle to get it running in a dev environment
```groovy
‚ùØ build.gradle

import org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem

project.ext.lwjglVersion = "3.3.1"

switch (OperatingSystem.current()) {
    case OperatingSystem.LINUX:
        project.ext.lwjglNatives = "natives-linux"
        break
    case OperatingSystem.WINDOWS:
        project.ext.lwjglNatives = "natives-windows"
        break
}

repositories {
   maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.Zarzelcow:legacy-lwjgl3:-SNAPSHOT"
    implementation platform("org.lwjgl:lwjgl-bom:$lwjglVersion")

    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl::$lwjglNatives"
    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-assimp::$lwjglNatives"
    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-glfw::$lwjglNatives"
    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-openal::$lwjglNatives"
    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-opengl::$lwjglNatives"
    runtimeOnly "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-stb::$lwjglNatives"
}

configurations.all {
    // Removes LWJGL2 dependencies
    exclude group: "org.lwjgl.lwjgl"
}
```

## Clients
 TODO... Btw users need to remove lwjgl2 from their classpath by hand as of now
 
# Performance Increases?
While increasing performance was not the main point you do very much so benefit from LWJGl 3's quite substantial performance
bump of about 20 fps even while having to emulate a lot of lwjgl 2 code that got removed.
